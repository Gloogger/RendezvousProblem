# RendezvousProblem
A MATLAB implementation of the Rendezvous problem. 

Problem Definition: 
  - Agents are assumed to have omni-directional sensing range (i.e., a circle)
  - Information exchange between agents are bi-directional
  - Multi-Agent System is viewed as an undirected and unweighted graph
  - Graph is dynamic (edges may be deleted or added as time changes)
